[Jeremias](/authors/jeremias/), [Matias](/authors/matias/) and [Yann](/authors/yann/) are organizing the Post-Bayesian online seminar series.

The series will discuss  cutting-edge methods for posteriors that no longer rely on Bayes Theorem (e.g., PAC-Bayes, generalised Bayes, Martingale posteriors, ...).
